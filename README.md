This project aims at predicting whether a particular person should be offered a loan or not using Neural Networks. Used the datasets of Lending Club company from Kaggle. Initially done some analysis on the data so that it will be easier to analyze the datasets which lead to successful completion of the prediction on whether to offer a loan to a random person or not given the details of him.
